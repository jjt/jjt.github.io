***TL;DR: It's a well-designed matrix keyboard with customizable open-source firmware and a durable split hand case, all backed by a good community***

The [ErgoDox][] is a split-hand ergonomic keyboard with mechanical switches and open source firmware running on a [Teensy][] microcontroller. While other keyboards offer dip-switches or even GUI config tools, the ErgoDox can be easily compiled from source. The firmware and layout(s) can be [compiled from source][0] or built and downloaded using MassDrop's [layout configuration tool][]. Flashing a new build onto the ErgoDox is easy with the multi-platform [Teensy loader][].

It was developed over the course of a couple of years by the users of [geekhack][] and [Deskthority][] and is the brain child of a Canadian who goes by Dox (hence the name). The forums are still alive with threads about the keyboard, including a lot of excellent custom builds.

I've been using one for over a year, after managing to snag one of the last prototype boards and assembling all the parts myself.
