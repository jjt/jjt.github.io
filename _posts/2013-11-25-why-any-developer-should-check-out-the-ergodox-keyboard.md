title: Why any developer should check out the ErgoDox keyboard
layout: post
---

The [ErgoDox][] is a split-hand ergonomic keyboard with mechanical switches and open source firmware running on a [Teensy][] microcontroller. While other keyboards offer dip-switches or even GUI config tools, the ErgoDox can be easily compiled from source. Custom layouts and firmware can be [compiled from source][0], or using MassDrop's [layout config tool][]. 

It was developed over the course of a couple of years by the users of [geekhack][] and [Deskthority][] and is the brain child of a Canadian who goes by Dox. Hence the name, ErgoDox.

I've been using one for over a year now and Here's my Colemak programmer's layout that has a layer the home row

### Open source firmware

### Adjustable ergonomics
Split keyboard halves offer flexibility
